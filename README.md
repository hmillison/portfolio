Portfolio Website
=========
This is a website I built as a sort of interactive resume and place to share my latest work.

The current iteration of this website first started as a mockup for my Graphic Design final project
at the University of Michigan. After iterating on this design with my professors (big thanks to them!)
I built what you see here with SASS, using Bourbon/Neat for a grid system. Initially, I was using jQuery
to have some smooth scrolling and highlighting of the links at the top. In the interest of optimization,
I removed some of this extraneous functionality and ported the rest to vanilla JavaScript.

Hope you like it!
